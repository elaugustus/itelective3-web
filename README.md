  As part of the continuous progress and innovation by the local city government, the Payroll Management System holds itself as a web-application platform that caters to employees that have been legally employed by Tagum City’s local government unit/s. The platform is designed to secure the enlisted employees who should be receiving their salary, as guided by the local government. The platform is expected to contain the data necessary for the monthly payroll. Additionally, the platform is also built to perform particular transactions and processes that would ease up the traditional payroll system.

  In order for the management system to cohesively work, the system contains sub-systems that would be significant in understanding the complexity and nature of the different tasks and transactions that the system must assume. 
  </p>

<br>
<br>

  <b>
    1. EMPLOYEES
  </b>
  <br>
  <br>
    <p align="justify">
    The system must be able to allow employees to conveniently perform their traditional tasks in building their payroll information. Traditionally, each employee must be able to determine their preference in terms of the payment method, submit their authenticated timecard, and their employee report. These traditional methods of payroll assessment must be inherited by the system. In doing so, each employee is expected to secure an account with their log-in details. Through that, each employee will be able to fill the required information necessary for the payroll system.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <b> 
    2. PROJECT MANAGEMENT DATABASE
  </b>
  <br> 
  <br> 
    <p align="justify">
    In a traditional sense, each of the employee’s necessary payroll information, such as their preference, personal information, performance, are all contained exclusively in the HR Department. While that is still necessary, the Payroll Management System is expected to hold the working hours accumulated by the employee, reports, and preferences that would all be necessary to create a payroll. The Payroll Management System has to secure each of the employee’s assessed information to the database, and would simply return it when queried or utilized.
    </p>
  <br>
  <br> 
  <b>
    3. THE PAYROLL ADMINISTRATOR 
  </b>
  <br>
  <br>
    <p align="justify">
    To ensure that the employee who has been enlisted in the system is active and is still a part of the city government’s employees, the payroll administrator will have the authority to remove, add, and manage the people who have access to the platform. Once the employee is officially deemed inactive, the Payroll administrator has the capacity to remove the employee from the list. The administrator would also have to create an official report regarding the employees in the payroll. Through this, the management system would be maintained and properly assessed, securing that there wouldn’t be any anomalies in the list. 
    </p>
  <br>
  <br> 
  <b> 
    4. SYSTEM CLOCK
  </b>
  <br> 
  <br> 
    <p align="justify">
      The System Clock enables the company, which in this case is the local city government, to determine when the payroll has been run. This is necessary in order for the design government unit to deposit/distribute the salary to the respective employees, and for the payroll to be printed.

      FEATURES OF DRUPAL 
    </b>
  <p align="justify">
    
  Drupal acts as the central component of Digital Experience Platform (DXP), which means that developers can integrate the platform with payment gateways, CRMs, analytics tools, social media, and marketing automation platforms. In hindsight, Drupal is a flexible platform with highly customizable features, freely available modules, and active community. It enables editors and administrators to easily search, draft, edit, publish content. Conveniently, Drupal also opens itself to users who have no coding background by offering layouts and templates. Lastly, Drupal offers a cohesive workflow, online directors, interactive website designs, and marketing portals—all of which are useful to the overall development of this particular project.
